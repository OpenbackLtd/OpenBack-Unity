# OpenBack Android Bootstrap

A simple project to create a module `OpenBackBootstrap.aar` comprised of a manifest and basic Application bootstrap for OpenBack. When Unity is building the Android project, the manifest files are merged. This manifest sets the `android:name` to use this class as the main application. From there we start OpenBack.
